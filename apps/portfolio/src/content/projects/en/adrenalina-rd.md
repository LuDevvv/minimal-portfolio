## Overview

**AdrenalinaRD** is a digital platform designed to modernize raffle organization, providing a secure and transparent environment for both organizers and participants. The system digitalizes the entire process, from ticket sales to payment management and winner selection, resolving the opacity and complexity of traditional manual raffles.

## The Challenge

The traditional raffle market faces trust issues due to a lack of transparency in draws and difficulty verifying ticket authenticity. Additionally, manual management limits geographic reach and complicates financial control and event scalability.

### Key Objectives
- **Transparency**: Implement an auditable system for winner selection.
- **Security**: Ensure payment integrity and prevent fraud or ticket duplication.
- **Comprehensive Management**: Centralize sales, user, and draw control in a single tool.

## My Solution

I developed a complete solution with a modern client-server architecture:

- **Robust Platform**: SPA Frontend with **React 18** and Vite for a smooth user experience, and a **Node.js/Express** Backend for business logic.
- **Data Management**: Implementation of **Prisma ORM** with **MySQL** to ensure relational integrity of users, tickets, and transactions.
- **Local Payments**: Secure integration with **UepaPay** to process cards and transfers in the local market.
- **Administrative Panel**: Complete dashboard for raffle creation, real-time sales monitoring, and user/role management.

## Impact

The platform enables organizations and businesses to conduct professional raffles efficiently:
- **Automation**: Automatic winner selection and ticket generation.
- **Trust**: Transparent ticket and payment verification for the end user.
- **Accessibility**: Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Context API
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM, JWT
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Infrastructure**: Docker (Containerization)
- **Payments**: UepaPay Integration
