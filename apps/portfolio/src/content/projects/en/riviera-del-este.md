## Overview

**Riviera del Este** is a digital platform developed to promote a residential complex in San Pedro de Macorís. The main goal was to create an effective tool to showcase the project and facilitate contact with interested clients, prioritizing clarity and ease of use.

## The Technical Challenge

The project required balancing a high visual load (images and property tours) with optimal performance across various devices. It was necessary to ensure a fluid navigation experience and efficient media loading to retain user attention.

### Key Objectives
- **Load Optimization**: Maintain good Core Web Vitals scores.
- **Bilingual Support**: Content accessible in English and Spanish.
- **Contact Flow**: Simplify the process from viewing to lead registration.

## My Solution

I developed a modern web application focused on usability and performance:

- **Efficient Architecture**: Using Next.js 15 for fast rendering and search engine friendliness.
- **Media Management**: Implementation of **Cloudinary** for optimized delivery of images and videos based on the user's device.
- **Interactive Interface**: Using **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions that enhance navigation without overwhelming the visual experience.
- **Functional Forms**: Secure contact system with data validation and automated notifications via Resend API.

## Business Impact

- **Improved Navigation**: Progressive loading and smooth navigation help maintain user interest.
- **Appointment Management**: The integrated form facilitates initial coordination with the sales team.
- **International Accessibility**: The multi-language option allows presenting the project to a broader audience directly.

### Tech Stack
- **Core**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Internationalization**: next-intl
- **Animations**: Framer Motion, Lenis Scroll
- **Backend/Services**: Resend API, Cloudinary
