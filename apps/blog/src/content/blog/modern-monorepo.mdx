# Modern Web Architectures

When I started building out my latest set of projects—my personal portfolio, a blog, and a link scraper—I realized I was duplicating a lot of my design system and core components. Every time I changed a color or a font in my portfolio, I had to manually update the other apps.

Enter the **Monorepo**.

Using a monorepo allows me to:
1. **Share Components**: I can have a `packages/ui` folder that all my apps import from.
2. **Unified Dependencies**: Upgrading a library like Tailwind CSS is done once at the root.
3. **Better DX**: I can run `pnpm dev` and have all my projects running simultaneously.

## Deployment with Cloudflare

Deploying these apps to Cloudflare is seamless. Each app in the `apps/` directory can be mapped to its own subdomain (e.g., `blog.ludevgarcia.com`) while sharing the same source of truth.

Stay tuned for more updates on my tech stack!
