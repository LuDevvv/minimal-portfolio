Building an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** isn't just about making "something fast" or a stripped-down version of your final vision. At its core, it's about building the absolute minimum required to validate a business hypothesis with real users.

Throughout my 4+ years of building digital products, I've seen many startups make the same mistake: spending months polishing features that no one actually uses.

### How to approach your MVP:

1. **Define the core problem**: What pain point are you actually solving?
2. **Identify the critical path**: If you could only have one feature, what would it be?
3. **Measure and learn**: Code is secondary; the feedback you get from users is the real gold.

Avoid the "over-engineering" trap. A successful MVP is one that allows you to pivot or scale based on data, not assumptions.
