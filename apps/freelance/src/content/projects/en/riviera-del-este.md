## Overview

**Riviera del Este** represents excellence in digital real estate development. I designed this high-performance platform to promote a luxury residential complex in San Pedro de Macoris, focusing obsessively on **converting visitors into qualified leads**.

## The Technical Challenge

The luxury market demands visual perfection without sacrificing speed. The challenge was to deliver an immersive media-rich experience (videos, high-res galleries) that loaded instantly, even on unstable mobile connections.

### Key Objectives
- **Elite Speed**: Aggressive optimization of Core Web Vitals.
- **Internationalization**: Native experience in English and Spanish without reloads.
- **Conversion**: Reducing friction between visual interest and contact.

## My Solution

I built a SPA (Single Page Application) using the latest in modern web technology:

- **Next.js 15 (App Router)**: Leveraging Server Components for ultra-fast rendering and superior SEO.
- **Media Optimization**: Integration with **Cloudinary** to serve adaptive AVIF/WebP images and progressive video loading.
- **Dynamic UI/UX**: Subtle animations with **Framer Motion** guiding user gaze toward CTAs, and an intuitive property filtering system.
- **Smart Forms**: Integration with Resend API and Zod validation to ensure clean leads and instant agent notifications.

## Business Impact

- **Retention**: Smooth scrolling and fast loading significantly increased time-on-page.
- **Acquisition**: The smart calendar contact form optimized sales scheduling, automatically filtering unavailable dates.
- **Global Reach**: The multilingual architecture effectively opened the project to international investors.

### Tech Stack
- **Core**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Internationalization**: next-intl
- **Animations**: Framer Motion, Lenis Scroll
- **Backend/Services**: Resend API, Cloudinary
